> ### My 5th App project

>> This is my fifth Android Studio project, at this project i worked with GdX api, for 2d game programming. It took me 1 week to finish, it's a simple app. <br> I made a final code review now that i finished the course, but I left the code exactly as i did, so that an analysis of my learning process could be done. <br> Also i left a video of the application presented by the professor, so could be done a comparison about what was supposed to be made, and what i presented. As you'll see throughout the apps i've created, i don't like to just copy and paste what the professor was asking, everytime he showed something to do, i would stop the video and start making the code with my own thoughts and solve every problem by my own.
